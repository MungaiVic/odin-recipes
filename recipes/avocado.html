		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>
			Avocado, bacon, and eggs are such a great combination! This is a quick and
			easy way to take deviled eggs to a new level! I won't make them without
			avocado! It adds so much taste and texture.
		</p>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>4 slices bacon, trimmed of fat and cut into small pieces</li>
			<li>1 avocado, halved and pitted</li>
			<li>6 hard-boiled eggs, halved</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon mayonnaise</li>
			<li>2 teaspoons prepared yellow mustard</li>
			<li>1 splash lime juice</li>
			<li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<p>
			Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning
			occasionally, until evenly browned, about 5 minutes. Drain on paper
			towels.
		</p>
		<p>
			Mash avocado in a large bowl with a fork. Mix in bacon, yolks from the
			hard-boiled eggs, mayonnaise, mustard, and lime juice.
		</p>
		<p>
			Spoon avocado mixture into the egg whites. Garnish eggs with red pepper
			flakes. Chill until ready to serve.
